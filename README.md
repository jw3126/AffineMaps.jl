# AffineMaps
## Relation to AffineTransforms.jl
[AffineTransforms.jl](https://github.com/timholy/AffineTransforms.jl) is about invertible affine transforms, while this package is about not necessarily invertible ones. Also AffineMaps uses Base.Matrix and Base.Vector, while this package is meant to be used with [FixedSizeArrays.jl](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/FixedSizeArrays.jl) or [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/andyferris/StaticArrays.jl).
